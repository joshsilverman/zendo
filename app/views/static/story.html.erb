<h3>Josh's Story</h3>
			<p>StudyEgg was born out of a problem that has been impacting me for the last decade.  It probably goes back much further than that, but it really started becoming apparent in high school. Like many students, I didn&rsquo;t really know how to study effectively.  Mix that with a little bit of procrastination and guess what happens. I would cram as much info into my brain before a test as I could, regurgitate it onto an exam page the next day, and within a month - POOF - it had all disappeared like some cruel magic trick. Sound familiar?</p>
			<p>Fast forward a little now to the college years.  Despite becoming more and more interested in my favorite subjects (French and political science), nothing had changed.  I still wasn&rsquo;t retaining as much of it as I wanted down the road.  Studying was like putting out fires- cramming for a test one day, and finishing just in time to bang out a paper the next.  The worst of it was that my grades were fine so there wasn&rsquo;t a real imperative to change.  So I continued along with that vicious cycle of cramming, testing, and forgetting for the next four years.</p>
			<p>Toward the end of my time in college I started tutoring students in math.  Little did I know when I signed up for that, the journey that it would take me on.  Tutoring awakened a passion for teaching others that I couldn&rsquo;t ignore.  Upon graduating I moved to South Korea and taught 5th graders English and IT.  My students were truly amazing, brilliant children.  But it turns out they all suffered from amnesia!  At least that&rsquo;s the only solution I had for why I would teach them something (and they would clearly understand it) one week, then reference it 2 weeks later only to be met by sea of blank stares.  Complete. Amnesia.</p>
			<p>After South Korea, I taught math and ESL in Spain for a year.  There must be something in the juice boxes these days, because all of my little niños and niñas were suffering from the same amnesia as those South Korean 5th graders! I would teach. They would do great in class and on quizzes. I would talk about it a month later.  They would look at me like I had four heads. Rinse and repeat.  After reflecting on this experience a little longer it finally dawned on me that these students were no different from me when I was in school. I left Spain on a mission to end this forgetful cycle of &ldquo;learning&rdquo; that so many of us fall victim to.</p>
			<p>I began pouring over pages and pages of research, and what I found out was very interesting.  The problem is in how people study.</p>
			<p>I took this research and applied it to my first attempt at a solution, Memenomix.  My interest in cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience continued to grow as I learned more about this fascinating topic of how our memories work.  It wasn&rsquo;t long before I decided to back to school and get a degree in computer science.</p>
			<p>The seed for StudyEgg was planted back when I was in high school.  Probably well before that, actually, but it really hit me in high school.  Like many students I didn&rsquo;t really know how to study.  The result? I would cram all the info into my brain before a test, regurgitate it onto an exam page, and forget it within a month. Sound familiar?  Even for the subjects I was excited about it the facts would fade.  This was a problem.  A problem that followed me after high school into my time at UPenn.  If anything it got worse in college! I spent more time studying and felt like I was holding on to less and less of it long term.  I love French and political science.  They were my two favorite subjects for that 8 year period of my life (they are still huge interests of mine).  But I probably remember less than 20% of what I&rsquo;ve learned in those classes at this point.  Something is broken.</p>
			<p>Time to switch gears a little bit. My senior year at UPenn I began tutoring students in math.  This was my first real taste of the other side of the metaphorical educational coin.  It awakened a passion in me that took me on an incredible journey.  After graduation I traveled to South Korea where I taught English language arts and IT to 5th graders and then to Spain where I taught 7th and 8th graders math and ESL.  This was such a rewarding experience and it taught me so much.  The only problem was that all my kids had amnesia!  The very same amnesia I&rsquo;d been suffering from.  Nothing stuck!  It&rsquo;s not for lack of trying.  They were clearly putting in the effort and doing well while we were on a topic.  But if you brought up something covered 2 weeks ago it was like addressing a brick wall.  Blank. Stares.</p>
			<p>This was the turning point.  After seeing it in so many of my students and then reflecting on how much it happened to me.</p>
