<h3>The Vision</h3>
<p>Our mission here at StudyEgg is to make studying easier, less stressful, and more effective.  For too many students learning has become an exercise in putting out fires. Cramming in just enough to do well on an exam (or not) the night before. Finishing just in time to do it all over again with a different class.  Studying this way is not only high stress but itâ€™s an extremely ineffective way to learn.  StudyEgg changes all that by utilizing state-of-the-art learning research to help students learn better, retain information longer, and spend less time studying.  We built StudyEgg to address these universal student issues of time and stress directly and, as students and StudyEgg users ourselves, we can confidently proclaim: It works!</p>
