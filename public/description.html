      <h3>Barriers to learning:</h3>
      <ul class="license-properties"
          <li>We believe that most students like learning. However student lives are full of distractions and studying is often pushed off to the last minute. As assessments approach, students end up frantically cramming as much info into their heads as possible. It often disappears as quickly as it is learned.</li>

            Many students are frustrated by this ineffective learning process. Studying often feels stressful and the result of studying does not feel like learning.
