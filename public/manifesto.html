      <h3>Our people:</h3>
      <ul class="license-properties"
          <li>The folks we care about are students who have at least some genuine interest in what they are learning in college. Despite this sincere interest, they end up studying at the last minute and cutting a lot of corners: scanning textbooks, cycling through past exams, etc.  These stressful study methods result in terrible retention and are deeply misaligned with research in the learning sciences. The end result is that students stuff as much information in their heads as needed to meet a minimum standard. The info fades nearly as quickly as its consumed.</li>

      <ul class="license-properties" style="text-align: left" dir="ltr">
        <li rel="cc:requires" resource="http://creativecommons.org/ns#Attribution" class="license by">
            We believe that the valuable lessons students learn in college classes should ramain with them through their studies and beyond. Furthermore, the time and effort invested by students in their education is sufficient for dramatically better learning outcomes. By reducing stress around studying and applying the latest research in the learning sciences, we aim to improve learning outcomes by an order of magnitude.
