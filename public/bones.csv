term,definition,question,incorrect answers
Ulna,"The ulna is one of the two long bones in the forearm, the other being the radius. It is prismatic in form and runs parallel to the radius, which is shorter and smaller. In anatomical position  the ulna is located at the side of the forearm closest to the body, the side of the little finger. The corresponding bone in the leg is the fibula.","Which is one of the two long bones in the forearm, the other being the radius?",Ulna,Humerus,User:Dust.of.nations/Humorous,Acromion,Anatomical neck of humerus
Femur,"The femur, or thigh bone, is the most proximal  bone of the leg in tetrapod vertebrates capable of walking or jumping, such as most land mammals, birds, many reptiles such as lizards, and amphibians such as frogs. In vertebrates with four legs such as dogs and horses, the femur is found only in the rear legs. The femur is the largest bone in the body. The head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum.","Which is the most proximal  bone of the leg in tetrapod vertebrates capable of walking or jumping, such as most land mammals, birds, many reptiles such as lizards, and amphibians such as frogs?",Anterior intercondylar area,Ulna,Humerus,Acetabulum,User:Dust.of.nations/Humorous,Adductor tubercle of femur
Tibia,"The tibia, shinbone, or shankbone is the larger and stronger of the two bones in the leg below the knee in vertebrates, and connects the knee with the ankle bones. The tibia is named for the Greek aulos flute, also known as a tibia. It is commonly recognized as the strongest weight bearing bone in the body.","Which is the larger and stronger of the two bones in the leg below the knee in vertebrates , and connects the knee with the ankle bones?",Anterior intercondylar area,Ulna,Humerus,Acetabulum,User:Dust.of.nations/Humorous,Adductor tubercle of femur
Fibula,"The fibula or calf bone is a bone located on the lateral side of the tibia, with which it is connected above and below. It is the smaller of the two bones, and, in proportion to its length, the most slender of all the long bones. Its upper extremity is small, placed toward the back of the head of the tibia, below the level of the knee-joint, and excluded from the formation of this joint. Its lower extremity inclines a little forward, so as to be on a plane anterior to that of the upper end; it projects below the tibia, and forms the lateral part of the ankle-joint.","Which is a bone located on the lateral side of the tibia, with which it is connected above and below?",Anterior intercondylar area,Ulna,Humerus,Acetabulum,User:Dust.of.nations/Humorous,Adductor tubercle of femur
Scapula,"In anatomy, the scapula, omo, or shoulder blade, is the bone that connects the humerus  with the clavicle .",Which is the bone that connects the humerus  with the clavicle?,Ulna,Scapula,Skull roof,Acromion,Skull,Anatomical neck of humerus
Jaw,"The ulna is one of the two long bones in the forearm, the other being the radius. It is prismatic in form and runs parallel to the radius, which is shorter and smaller. In anatomical position  the ulna is located at the side of the forearm closest to the body, the side of the little finger. The corresponding bone in the leg is the fibula.","Which is one of the two long bones in the forearm, the other being the radius?",Ulna,Humerus,User:Dust.of.nations/Humorous,Acromion,Anatomical neck of humerus
