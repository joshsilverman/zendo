"perception ","Perception is the process of attaining awareness or understanding of the environment by organizing and interpreting sensory information. All perception involves signals in the nervous system, which in turn result from physical stimulation of the sense organs. For example, vision involves light striking the retinas of the eyes, smell is mediated by odor molecules and hearing involves pressure waves. Perception is not the passive receipt of these signals, but can be shaped by learning, memory and expectation. Perception involves these ""top-down"" effects as well as the ""bottom-up"" process of processing sensory input. Perception depends on complex functions of the nervous system, but subjectively seems mostly effortless because this processing happens outside conscious awareness.","Which is the process of attaining awareness or understanding of the environment by organizing and interpreting sensory information?","Volition","Intention","Attention"

The emphasis on visual illusions occurs because vision often dominates the other senses. For example, individuals watching a ventriloquist will perceive the voice is coming from the dummy since they are able to see the dummy mouth the words. Some illusions are based on general assumptions the brain makes during perception. These assumptions are made using organizational principles, like Gestalt, an individual's ability of depth perception and motion perception, and perceptual constancy.

"parietal cortex ","The parietal lobe is a part of the brain positioned above the occipital lobe and behind the frontal lobe. The parietal lobe integrates sensory information from different modalities, particularly determining spatial sense and navigation. For example, it comprises somatosensory cortex and the dorsal stream of the visual system. This enables regions of the parietal cortex to map objects perceived visually into body coordinate positions.","Which is a part of the brain positioned above  the occipital lobe and behind  the frontal lobe that integrates sensory information from different modalities, particularly determining spatial sense and navigation?","Posterior parietal cortex","Calcarine fissure","Lateral sulcus"

It is a complex mental process studied in neurology.","Which is the ability of the human mind and senses to perceive the shapes of physical objects and outlines observed in the environment?","Volition","Apperception","Destratification"
"Lawrence Weiskrantz ","Lawrence Weiskrantz is a British psychologist who discovered the phenomenon of blindsight, which is the voluntary visually evoked response to a stimulus presented within a scotoma.","Which is a British psychologist, who discovered the phenomenon of blindsight, which is the voluntary visually evoked response to a stimulus presented within a scotoma?","Colin Blakemore","Peter Medawar","Vernon Benjamin Mountcastle"
"Cortical blindness","Cortical blindness is the total or partial loss of vision in a normal-appearing eye caused by damage to the visual area in the brain's occipital cortex. This damage is most often caused by loss of blood flow to the occipital cortex from either unilateral or bilateral posterior cerebral artery blockage. A patient with cortical blindness often has little or no insight that they have lost vision, a phenomenon known as Anton's Syndrome or Anton-Babinski syndrome.","Which is the total or partial loss of vision in a normal-appearing eye caused by damage to the visual area in the brain's occipital cortex?","Stereoblindness","Emmetropia","Pseudostrabismus"
"Blindsight","Blindsight is a phenomenon in which people who are perceptually blind in a certain area of their visual field demonstrate some response to visual stimuli. In Type 1 blindsight subjects have no awareness whatsoever of any stimuli, but yet are able to predict, at levels significantly above chance, aspects of a visual stimulus, such as location, or type of movement, often in a forced-response or guessing situation. Type 2 blindsight is when subjects have some awareness of, for example, movement within the blind area, but no visual percept. This may be caused by, for example, the person being aware of their eyes' tracking motion which will function normally. Blindsight is caused by injury to the part of the brain responsible for vision. Evidence for it can be indirectly observed in children as young as two months, although it is difficult to determine the type in a person who is not old enough to answer questions.","Which is a phenomenon in which people who are perceptually blind in a certain area of their visual field demonstrate some response to visual stimuli?","Xanthopsia","Autoscopy","Filling-in"
"case study ","A case study is an intensive analysis of an individual unit stressing developmental factors in relation to context. The case study is common in social sciences and life sciences. Case studies may be descriptive or explanatory. The latter type is used to explore causation in order to find underlying principles. They may be prospective, in which criteria are established and cases fitting the criteria are included as they become available, or retrospective, in which criteria are established for selecting cases from historical records for inclusion in the study.","Which is an intensive analysis of an individual unit  stressing developmental factors in relation to context?","Feasibility study","First-in-man study","Placebo-controlled study"
"Depth perception","Depth perception is the visual ability to perceive the world in three dimensions and the distance of an object. Depth sensation is the ability to move accurately, or to respond consistently, based on the distances of objects in an environment.","Which is the visual ability to perceive the world in three dimensions  and the distance of an object?","Fixation","Perception","Attention"
"lip-reading ","Lip reading, also known as lipreading or speechreading, is a technique of understanding speech by visually interpreting the movements of the lips, face and tongue with information provided by the context, language, and any residual hearing.","Which is a technique of understanding speech by visually interpreting the movements of the lips, face and tongue with information provided by the context, language, and any residual hearing?","Intermodal mapping","Perception training","Sign language"
"Superior temporal sulcus","The superior temporal sulcus is the sulcus separating the superior temporal gyrus from the middle temporal gyrus in the temporal lobe of the brain. The superior temporal sulcus is the first sulcus inferior to the lateral fissure. It is involved in the perception of where others are gazing and is thus important in determining where others' emotions are being directed. It is also involved in the perception of biological motion.","Which separates the superior temporal gyrus from the middle temporal gyrus in the temporal lobe of the brain and is involved in the perception of where others are gazing?","Cerebrum","Metathalamus","Allocortex"
"multisensory integration ","Multimodal integration, also known as multisensory integration, is the study of how information from the different sensory modalities, such as sight, sound, touch, smell, self-motion and taste, may be integrated by the nervous system. A coherent representation of objects combining modalities enables us to have meaningful perceptual experiences. Indeed, multisensory integration is central to adaptive behavior because it allows us to perceive a world of coherent perceptual entities. Multimodal integration also deals with how different sensory modalities interact with one another and alter each other’s processing.","Which is the study of how information from the different sensory modalities, such as sight, sound, touch, smell, self-motion and taste, may be integrated by the nervous system?","Amodal integration","Aesthetic interpretation","Action-Specific Perception"
"synesthesia ","Synesthesia, from the ancient Greek ???, ""together,"" and ????????, ""sensation,"" is a neurologically based condition in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway. People who report such experiences are known as synesthetes.","Which is a neurologically based condition in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway?","Graphesthesia","Polymodality","Chromesthesia"
"cortical plasticity ","Neuroplasticity is a non-specific neuroscience term referring to the ability of the brain and nervous system in all species to change structurally and functionally as a result of input from the environment. Plasticity occurs on a variety of levels, ranging from cellular changes involved in learning, to large-scale changes involved in cortical remapping in response to injury. The most widely recognized forms of plasticity are learning, memory, and recovery from brain damage. During most of the 20th century, the general consensus among neuroscientists was that brain structure is relatively immutable after a critical period during early childhood. This belief has been challenged by new findings, revealing that many aspects of the brain remain plastic even into adulthood.","Which is a non-specific neuroscience term referring to the ability of the brain and nervous system in all species to change structurally and functionally as a result of input from the environment?","Spasticity","Electrocorticography","Metaplasticity"
"Tactile discrimination","Tactile discrimination is the ability to differentiate information received through the sense of touch. This is often tested during neurological examination and represents a higher level of neurological function involving the cerebral cortex. Examples include the ability to discriminate between sharp and dull objects touching the skin, stereognosis, graphesthesia, and two-point discrimination.","Which is the ability to differentiate information received through the sense of touch?","Apperception","Electroreception","Perception"
